# Digital media competency guide for children
Introduce kids to the world of internet, social networks, data privacy and all the rest

## Why
Most kids aged around 10 in our school own at least a mobile if not a laptop/desktop and have access to the internet. Mostly used for playing games, there is usually limited to no guidance from home or at school how to use those devices properly in regards to data privacy, appropriate behaviour in social media, content consumption etc.
The goal of this project is to help those, who would like to step up and volunteer to educate their children at home or in classes, with inspiration and support.

## What
The concept is to use slides to introduce some facts and then discuss them with the kids. To make it more entertaining, videos and hands-on tasks have been integrated as well.

Currently an effort in german language, but you are welcome to contribute to other languages via pull request.

## How
The foundation of this project is to use free and open source software and media to create and demonstrate the content. Thus you just need a browser to play the slides which are embedded in a SVG vector graphics file for each chapter/lesson. To create those graphics files, only Inkscape with the Sozi plugin are required.

Either select the language of your choice and download the files you are interested in (right click on the file and chose "save link as..." to download the \*.svg files) or download the entire project with a Git tool like `git` on Linux systems
    git clone https://github.com/joschro/it4kids.git
or select "Clone or download" on https://github.com/joschro/it4kids and click on "Download ZIP".

Then open the SVG files in your standard browser and use the mouse buttons to navigate through the slides.
